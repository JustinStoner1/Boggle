Version one of the boggle project

Running the program will bring up a small window with a text box and a text field.
To check if a word is contained with the provided dictionary, type the word into the text field and press enter.
If the word is with the dictionary, a message will confirm this, if it is not, a different message will appear in the text, telling the user their word is not in the dictionary.
